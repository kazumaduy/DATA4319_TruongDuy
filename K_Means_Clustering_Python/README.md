# K Means Clustering
## A basic insight into the K Means Clustering algorithm in Python


### Required Packages
```python
import pandas as pd
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
from sklearn.cluster import KMeans
```
The K Means Clustering algorithm works by randomly choosing a centroid in comparison to the data, then iteratively chooses a new centroid by calculating optimal position.
